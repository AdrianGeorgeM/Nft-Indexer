Challenge suggestions:

Add Wallet integration so that any user that connects their wallet
can check see their NFTs in a flash!

There is no indication of a request in progress... that's bad UX!

Do you think you can add some sort of indication of loading?

Add some styling! ðŸŽ¨

The NFT images can sometimes appear and sometimes not... can you think of ways to fix that?

There is no error-checking for wrongly formed requests, or really any error checking of any kind... can you add some in?

The images and grid display could look better... anything you can do about that?

There are ways to make this app faster... can you implement some of them? How can the query be made even quicker?

Can you add ENS support for inputs?
